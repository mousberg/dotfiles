# Manual Terminal.app Theme Setup

Since direct importing of the theme file didn't work, here's how to manually recreate your Ghostty theme in Terminal.app:

1. **Open Terminal.app Preferences:**
   - Go to Terminal > Settings (or press Cmd+,)
   - Select a profile like "Pro" or "Basic" to modify
   
2. **Set Background:**
   - Click on the "Text" tab
   - Under "Background", click "Color & Effects"
   - Set the color to black (#000000)
   - Set "Opacity" to 70%
   - Enable "Blur" if you want the blur effect from Ghostty

3. **Set Text Color:**
   - In the same tab, set the text color to light gray (#c7c7c7)

4. **Window Size:**
   - Go to the "Window" tab
   - Set columns to 117 and rows to 38 (matching your Ghostty settings)

5. **Font:**
   - Go to the "Text" tab
   - Click "Change..." next to the font
   - Select "SF Mono" or similar (Terminal.app doesn't support Nerd Fonts directly)
   - Set the size to 11-12pt

6. **Save the Theme:**
   - Click the "+" button at the bottom of the sidebar to create a new profile based on your changes
   - Name it "GhosttyTheme"
   - Click "Default" to make it your default theme

This approach should give you a Terminal.app theme that closely matches your Ghostty setup, even if the automatic import didn't work.
